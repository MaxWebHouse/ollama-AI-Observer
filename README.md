# üèóÔ∏è Building Your Own Agent

Creating your own Observer AI agent is simple, and consist of three things:
1.- SENSORS - input that your model will have
2.- MODELS - models run by ollama or by Ob-Server
3.- TOOLS - functions for your model to use

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the Agent Dashboard and click "Create New Agent"
2. Fill in the "Configuration" tab with basic details (name, description, model, loop interval)
3. Give your model a system prompt and Sensors! The current Sensors that exist are:
   * **Screen OCR** ($SCREEN_OCR) Captures screen content as text via OCR (english only for now)
   * **Screenshot** ($SCREEN_64) Captures screen as an image for multimodal models
   * **Agent Memory** ($MEMORY@agent_id) Accesses agents' stored information
   * **Clipboard** ($CLIPBOARD) It pastes the clipboard contents 
   * **Microphone** ($MICROPHONE) Captures the microphone and adds a transcription (english only for now)
4.- Decide what tools do with your models `response` in the Code Tab:
  * `pushNotification(title, options)` ‚Äì Send notifications  
  * `getMemory(agentId)*` ‚Äì Retrieve stored memory (defaults to current agent)  
  * `setMemory(agentId, content)*` ‚Äì Replace stored memory  
  * `appendMemory(agentId, content)*` ‚Äì Add to existing memory  
  * `startAgent(agentId)*` ‚Äì Starts an agent  
  * `stopAgent(agentId)*` ‚Äì Stops an agent
  * `time()` - Gets current time

## Code Tab

The "Code" tab now offers a notebook-style coding experience where you can choose between JavaScript or Python execution:

### JavaScript (Browser-based)

JavaScript agents run in the browser sandbox, making them ideal for passive monitoring and notifications:

```javascript
// Remove Think tags for deepseek model
const cleanedResponse = response.replace(/<think>[\s\S]*?<\/think>/g, '').trim();

// Preserve previous memory
const prevMemory = await getMemory();

// Get time
const time = time();

// Update memory with timestamp
appendMemory(`[${time}] ${cleanedResponse}`);
```

> **Note:** any function marked with `*` takes an `agentId` argument.  
> If you omit `agentId`, it defaults to the agent that‚Äôs running the code.

Available utilities include:

* `time()` ‚Äì Get the current timestamp  
* `pushNotification(title, options)` ‚Äì Send notifications  
* `getMemory(agentId)*` ‚Äì Retrieve stored memory (defaults to current agent)  
* `setMemory(agentId, content)*` ‚Äì Replace stored memory  
* `appendMemory(agentId, content)*` ‚Äì Add to existing memory  
* `startAgent(agentId)*` ‚Äì Starts an agent  
* `stopAgent(agentId)*` ‚Äì Stops an agent


### Python (Jupyter Server)

Python agents run on a Jupyter server with system-level access, enabling them to interact directly with your computer:

```python
#python <-- don't remove this!
print("Hello World!", response, agentId)

# Example: Analyze screen content and take action
if "SHUTOFF" in response:
    # System level commands can be executed here
    import os
    # os.system("command")  # Be careful with system commands!
```

The Python environment receives:
* `response` - The model's output
* `agentId` - The current agent's ID

## Example: Command Tracking Agent

A simple agent that responds to specific commands in the model's output:

```javascript
//Clean response
const cleanedResponse = response.replace(/<think>[\s\S]*?<\/think>/g, '').trim();

//Command Format
if (cleanedResponse.includes("COMMAND")) {
  const withoutcommand = cleanedResponse.replace(/COMMAND:/g, '');
  setMemory(`${await getMemory()} \n[${time()}] ${withoutcommand}`);
}
```
## Jupyter Server Configuration

To use Python agents:

1. Run a Jupyter server on your machine
2. Configure the connection in the Observer AI interface:
   * Host: The server address (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
   * Port: The server port (e.g., 8888)
   * Token: Your Jupyter server authentication token
3. Test the connection using the "Test Connection" button
4. Switch to the Python tab in the code editor to write Python-based agents


# üöÄ Getting Started with Local Inference

There are a couple of ways to get Observer up and running with local inference. We recommend using Docker for the simplest setup.

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended & Easiest)

This method uses Docker Compose to run Observer and a local Ollama instance together in containers.

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (often included with Docker Desktop).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Clone this repository (or download the `docker-compose.yml` file):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Roy3838/Observer.git
    cd Observer
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    
3.  **Access Observer:**
    *   **Web UI:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`
    *   **Accept Local Certificates** Open up `https://localhost:3838` and your browser will show a warning about an "unsafe" or "untrusted" connection. This is because the proxy uses a self-signed SSL certificate for local HTTPS. You'll need to click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" (or similar wording) to accept it. These certificates are signed by your computer! and this step is needed to make the browser happy and let it "see" the ollama server.

4.  **Pull Ollama Models:**
    Once the services are running, you can pull models into your Ollama instance using the terminal feature in the Observer UI, or by running:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec ollama_service ollama pull llama3 # Or any other model
    ```
    OR by **Using the Web App:**
    *   Go to the Web UI (`http://localhost:8080`).
    *   In the Models tab, click on add model. This will give you the shell to your connected ollama instance, download models using ollama run. 

**To Stop Observer (Docker Setup):**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Deploy & Share

Save your agent, test it from the dashboard, and export the configuration to share with others!
