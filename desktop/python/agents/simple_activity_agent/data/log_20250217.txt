[14:45:20] Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the user is doing based on the screen content provided. Let me look through each line and see if I can piece together the activity.
[14:45:20] First, I notice commands like `npm run tau!` and `npm run build`. That makes me think the user is working on a project, probably using npm scripts. There's also mention of Tauri, which is a tool used in web development for building desktop applications with web technologies. So, the user might be developing a Tauri application.
[14:45:20] Looking further, I see commands like `cargo run` and `tsc & vite build`, which are related to Rust and TypeScript respectively. That confirms that the project is using multiple programming languages and tools. The user is likely working on both front-end and back-end development.
[14:45:20] There's also interaction with the terminal, such as running commands in a shell, which indicates they're actively coding or building their application. The presence of `@observer/desktop` suggests this is part of an observer application, possibly monitoring something in real-time.
[14:45:20] The user toggles between showing logs and CoT (Chain of Thought), which means they might be debugging or analyzing the activity logs to understand what's happening in their application.
[14:45:20] Putting it all together, the main activity seems to be actively developing a Tauri-based desktop application with multiple components. The user is using various tools like npm, cargo, tsc, and vite to build and run their project.
