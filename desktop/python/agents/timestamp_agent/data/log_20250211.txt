[14:27:01] You are an activity tracking assistant that analyzes screen content to understand what the user is doing.
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the current screen content
2. Determine if the user's activity has changed from the last recorded activity
3. Write a concise description of any new activity

Available commands:
WRITE_ACTIVITY: activity_description
READ_LAST_ACTIVITY: None

Guidelines for activity descriptions:
- Be concise but descriptive (e.g., "Writing code in VS Code", "Browsing web in Chrome")
- Focus on the main activity visible on screen
- Include the application name when relevant
- Don't include temporary or quick changes
- Group similar activities together

Remember: Only record new activities when there's a significant change in what the user is doing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the user is doing based on the screen content provided. Let me start by reading through all the information carefully.

First, I notice that there are a lot of lines with ">>>". These seem like command prompts or outputs from terminal sessions. Then there's some Python code with classes and methods, specifically related to an agent setup, importing modules like Capture and Model, initializing components, etc. There are also error messages mentioning model not found, which suggests the user might be running into issues with their setup.

Looking further, I see commands like "python3 run.py", which indicates the user is executing a Python script. The script starts an agent and handles KeyboardInterrupt exceptions to stop it gracefully. There's also a mention of Ollama, which is a tool for running models, and some SSH commands connecting to a remote host.

The errors mention that the model 'deepseek-r1:8b' isn't found, which might mean the user is trying to run a model they don't have access to or it's not properly set up. The timestamps show that this happened around February 11 at 11:41, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

I also see references to directories like 'agents' and 'data', which could be part of the agent setup. There are multiple instances where the user is running commands like "python3 run.py" and getting the same error, so they might be encountering a recurring issue.

Putting this together, it seems like the user is working on an AI/agent project. They're writing Python code to initialize an agent, probably for some NLP task given the mention of models like deepseek-r1. The errors suggest there's a problem with model initialization or connectivity issues.

The main activities would be:

1. Running a Python script to start and control an agent.
2. Initializing AI components like Capture and Model.
3. Attempting to run a specific model, encountering errors related to it not being found.

I don't see any new activities beyond this, as the user seems to be stuck on the same issue with their model. So, there's no significant change from the last activity in terms of what they're doing—they're still trying to run their agent script and facing the same error each time.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the current screen content
2. Determine if the user's activity has changed from the last recorded activity
3. Write a concise description of any new activity

Available commands:
WRITE_ACTIVITY: activity_description
READ_LAST_ACTIVITY: None

Guidelines for activity descriptions:
- Be concise but descriptive (e.g., "Writing code in VS Code", "Browsing web in Chrome")
- Focus on the main activity visible on screen
- Include the application name when relevant
- Don't include temporary or quick changes
- Group similar activities together

Remember: Only record new activities when there's a significant change in what the user is doing.
